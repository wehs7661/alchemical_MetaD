Using 128 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: PME load balancing increased the non-bonded workload by more than 50%.
      For better performance, use (more) PME ranks (mdrun -npme),
      or if you are beyond the scaling limit, use fewer total ranks (or nodes).


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB got disabled because it was unsuitable to use.
 Average load imbalance: 14.2%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 71%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 10.1%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.196
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 5.9 %

NOTE: 10.1 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You can consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.
NOTE: 5.9 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.


NOTE: 24 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options

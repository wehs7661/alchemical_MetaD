Reading file sys2.tpr, VERSION 2021.4-plumed-2.8.0 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 40, rlist from 0.9 to 0.999

Using 64 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 2 OpenMP threads per MPI process

starting mdrun 'Generic title in water'
100000000 steps, 200000.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB got disabled because it was unsuitable to use.
 Average load imbalance: 11.0%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 68%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 7.4%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.994
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 0.2 %

NOTE: 7.4 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You can consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.

NOTE: 5 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options

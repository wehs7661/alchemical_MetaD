Reading file sys2.tpr, VERSION 2021.4-plumed-2.8.0 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 40, rlist from 0.9 to 0.999

Using 64 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 2 OpenMP threads per MPI process

starting mdrun 'Generic title in water'
100000000 steps, 200000.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB got disabled because it was unsuitable to use.
 Average load imbalance: 7.4%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 57%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 4.2%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.747
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 13.6 %

NOTE: 13.6 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.

GROMACS reminds you: "A good sign these days when you're listening to someone talk about this epidemic is the number of times they say 'We don't know yet'. The more of those, the better." (Derek Lowe)

alchemical_MetaD
================

## Description
This is a repository for maintaining the simulation files for the alchemical metadynamics project, which investigated three different test systems/alchemical processes, including decoupling an argon atom or a 4-site model from water, and the binding/unbinding of the host-guest bindign complex CB8-G3. Some prevliminary tests of the project were stored in the archived project [MetaD_EXE_TestSys](https://github.com/wehs7661/MetaD_EXE_TestSys).
